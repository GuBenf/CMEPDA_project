This repository contains the code and the data of the simulation of a Fundamental Interactions Physics Laboratory experiment, made with Geant4 for the CMEPDA exam at UNIPI.
The experiment is aimed at measuring the mean life of the muon, using plastic scintillators
The experiment is aimed at measuring the mean life of the muon, using plastic scintillators and PMTs.
The simulation is made generating muons with a momentum extracted from a Gaussian distribution with mean $m =80$ MeV/c
